Twitch.tv User Viewer
=====================

- Starting August 8th, 2016, Twitch will require a Client-ID header with all Kraken API requests. This version is set to work on localhost, but anywhere else will require your own ID. Read more here: https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843#.prrqkxvr8

- Saves user list in localStorage. Please note that IE/Edge does not allow local use of localStorage, but viewing the CodePen link in IE/Edge will work.

- Esc is shortcut for closing search results panel.

- Includes Gulp build scripts.
